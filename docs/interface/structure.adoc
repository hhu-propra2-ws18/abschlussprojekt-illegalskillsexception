=== Interface structure
The interface of the REST API was designed using the domains of the backend and
the feature domains of the frontend.

This resulted in the following top level interfaces:

* *`borrow`:* Everything a "borrow" user can do, so borrowing an item, seeing
the transaction he is involved in as borrower etc.
* *`buy`:* Everything related to buying an item as a normal user (and not item owner)
* *`lend`:* Functions related to being a 'lender', e.g. uploading items,
* *`sell`:* Functionality for puting items up for sale
accepting inquiries
* *`user`:* Interface for signing up new users, logging in users and accessing
detailed informations about users

Every API request (except sign-up and login) require a present authorization
token, which will be sent in the header. This token is then used to check if a
user is authorized and is then used to identify the user.
